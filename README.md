# <p align="center"> <ins>Welcome, you can call me Deci!</ins> <br />
<p align="center"> I go by he/it most of the time. I have undiagnosed autism and questioning adhd + bpd! <br />
I am in various fandoms, but my biggest fixation is DnB. I mostly hang around the DnB area, however sometimes I go sit in other places near the dock. <br />
  <br />
I'm usually offtab when I'm not with anyone in PT. <ins>please keep this in mind.</ins> <br />
Sometimes my names will have acronyms for whether I want people to interact or not. If you would like to interact, <ins>PLEASE</ins> whisper me. Friends or acquaintances don't have to whisper. If i don't respond, Im probably offtab or im nervous to talk. <br />
--------------- <br />
DNI = Do not interact <br />
DNIUC = Do not interact unless close <br />
W2I = Whisper to interact <br />
--------------- <br />
I would prefer people to not boop me or start a convo or anything unless I am already talking to you. If not, do NOT do this <ins>PERIOD</ins>, i  will either ignore you or hide you. however, you may crown me! <br />
I am not obligated to talk to you if im not comfortable. <br />
(Also don't copy my skins. this is pretty obvious. you can ask how I made certain things, but you cant just copy everythin) <br />
<br />
Thank you for reading!
