# <p align="center"> Welcome, you can call me Deci! <br />
<p align="center"> I go by he/it most of the time. I have undiagnosed autism and questioning adhd + bpd! <br />
I am in various fandoms, but my biggest fixation is DnB. I mostly hang around the DnB area, however sometimes I go sit in other places near the dock. <br />
  <br />
I'm usually offtab when I'm not with anyone in PT. please keep this in mind. <br />
Sometimes my names will have acronyms for whether I want people to interact or not. If you would like to interact, PLEASE whisper me. If i don't respond, Im probably offtab. <br />
--------------- <br />
DNI = Do not interact <br />
DNIUC = Do not interact unless close <br />
W2I = Whisper to interact <br />
--------------- <br />
I would prefer people to not boop me or start a convo or anything unless I am already talking to you. If not, do not do this PERIOD, i  will either ignore you or hide you. however, you may crown me! <br />
(Also don't copy my skins. this is pretty obvious. you can ask how I made certain things, but you cant just copy everythin) <br />
<br />
Thank you for reading!
